# The following folders and files names are defined by parameters on the 'icons-svg' and 'icons-sass'
# scripts. Please, do not change those names, and if you do, update the names here, so that those folders
# and files keep being ignored. "/config" and "/svg-source" are the only source, the rest are generated.
