# GeneXus Next IDE Plugin Sample

This repository provides a sample project that demonstrates how to build plugins for the GeneXus Next IDE. The project is organized into two main sections: backend and frontend.

The **backend** is responsible for handling business logic and service layer interactions. It defines the objects, parts, and controllers that support the plugin's functionality.

The **frontend** defines the contributions to the IDE. These contributions include new user interface components, dialogs, editors, commands, etc.

To begin, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions for both the backend and frontend.
